# Card Thumbnail Extractor

In this folder are some Jupyter Notebooks showing the approach:

- [`character-box`](./character-box.ipynb) - Getting the character box from a screenshot of the character list
- [`thumbnail-search`](./thumbnail-search.ipynb) - Extracting individual card thumbnails from the character list

To run these notebooks:

- Install Python 3.11 or higher (may work on older versions, but not sure if it'll work)
- [Create a virtual environment and activate it](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `jupyter notebook`
